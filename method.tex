\section{Method}

\subsection{Examination method}

Preliminary method is using the mentioned distributed version of NAF and extend
it with pose estimates from a convolutional neural network. This network is
pretrained as in \cite{yahya2016collective} by randomly placing objects and the
end-effector and this way generating training data. Several robots will be used
to parallelize the training process. The preliminary manipulation task is pushing
of objects to some random target position.

\subsection{Conditions}

There will be need for several robot setups, each including a robot,
computer, and camera. These will have to be able to communicate with a separate
computer responsible for training the policies/neural networks. In the ideal
case, this computer is supplied and has a graphics card compatible with modern
neural network libraries.

\subsection{Limitations}

A proof of concept should be done with a corresponding report (the thesis).
There are no requirements for implementation of code that should be delivered
as libraries etc. The main contribution is the thesis. All code used for
conducting the experiments will be openly published on GitHub.
